todo:
    - Add new sensors
    - Reward function impl
    - Work with Multiple workers on cloud
    - Testing inference script
    - Working with tune to achieve best model
    - Parameters tuning:
        - dyamic weather
        - multiple towns
        - multiple cars
        - etc

fixed:
    - Tensor.cpu() to memory:
        - added on ~/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/ray/rllib/evaluation/postprocessing.py line:60
            if type(last_r)!=float:
                last_r = last_r.cpu()
    - Memory ray problem:
        - changed ~/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/ray/util/iter.py line:742 from 
                yield ray.get(futures, timeout=timeout)
            to
                yield [copy.deepcopy(ray.get(future)) for future in futures]
