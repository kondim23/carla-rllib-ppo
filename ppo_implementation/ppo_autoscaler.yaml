# The minimum number of workers nodes to launch in addition to the head
# node. This number should be >= 0.

# node. This takes precedence over min_workers.

# The autoscaler will scale up the cluster faster with higher upscaling speed.
# E.g., if the task requires adding more nodes then autoscaler will gradually
# scale up the cluster in chunks of upscaling_speed*currently_running_nodes.
# This number should be > 0.
